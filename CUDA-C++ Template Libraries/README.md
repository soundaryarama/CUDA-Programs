# thrust and cub

Thrust is a parallel algorithms library which resembles the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++. The reduce feature in thrust is used in this code to compute the sum of all elements in the range [first, last).

Cub is another library like thrust. The DeviceReduce::Sum feature is used to compute the sum of the numbers given as input.
