# Inclusive Scan using CUDA

The task2.cu file creates and fills an array using managed memory and calls a function called "scan1.cu". The scan function proves useful in many applications like building histograms, data structures like trees etc. This scan kernel function implements an inclusive scan using the 
Hillis-Steele algorithm. This algorithm
